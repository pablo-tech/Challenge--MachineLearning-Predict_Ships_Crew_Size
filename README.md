# ML Model to Predict Ships Crew Size

Author: Benjamin O. Tayo 

We build a simple model using the cruise_ship_info.csv data set for predicting a ship's crew size. This project is organized as follows: (a) data proprocessing and variable selection; (b) basic regression model; (c) hyper-parameters tuning; and (d) techniques for dimensionality reduction.
